# warmup: App Engine attempts to detect when your application needs a new instance, 
# and (assuming that warmup requests are enabled for your application) initiates a warmup 
# request to initialize the new instance. However, these detection attempts do not work in 
# every case. As a result, you may encounter loading requests, even if warmup requests are 
# enabled in your app. For example, if your app is serving no traffic, the first request to the 
# app will always be a loading request, not a warmup request.
