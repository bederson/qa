TODO

Bugs
* Users occasionally get the same idea assigned to them multiple times - why???
* Need better random assignment algorithm - seems very clumpy
  Made an improvement, need to try it with a class
* Can't submit idea when Chrome "disconnect.me" plugin installed
* Require user to be logged in to create a question in admin interface

Features
* Stem tags???
* Allow students to edit their tags
* Allow student pseudonym and/or google account
  (pseudonym only version would be useful for testing)
* Auto-complete or show tags that others have already entered for that cluster or idea
  (to make it easier and faster for students to enter tags, and for there to be less diversity
   ... if that's what we want)

Misc
* Need to make myself a gae admin so users.is_current_user_admin returns true

Engineering
* Better downloading support
* Only let owners or admin delete questions
* Build test harness
  (look at the Firefox extension Selenium: seleniumhq.org)

New approaches
* Cluster based on tags
* New clustering approach by asking student to incrementally say which items are most similar
* Final reclustering step based tags
* Have student provide drawings, and do peer clustering
* Provide a picture with a question, and have students point to place on image that provides answer (and aggregate answers)
* Combine with MOOC to give community of participants the ability to participate in real-time with each other
* Regular polls
* "Tag" with a fixed vocabulary - which would turn into a collective grading exercise. If participants could get back
  their originally contributed ideas, then it would turn into a kind of peer grading platform

Design issues
* General tension between student individual focus and how much they see of collective activity
* Should complete user name (which is email) be displaed on mouse over in instructor view?

Clustering
* Look at MALLET - http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php
* Read Jordan's paper
