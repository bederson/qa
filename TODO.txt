GAE Deployment
* download and install gsutil to make importing data easier:
  https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/docs/import_export#migrate
* create empty sql file containing database structure and import to Google Cloud SQL database
* create Google Cloud SQL database user to use instead of root

To Do
* What needs to be created w/in transactions to ensure same id not used when new database item created?  
  Or does InnoDB handle this ...

Features
* Use stemming when comparing categories for equality
* Allow admins to modify questions, in addition to question authors
* Allow admins to logout students

Misc Improvements
* Reduce page reloads to reduce unnecessary server calls and # of channels created
* Need better way to create unique question id
* Need consistent terminology (e.g., submission/note/response/idea, person/user/author)
* Create database indexes
* Destroy channels after some specified period (or does that happen automatically?)
* Consider what can be stored in datastore and/or memcache to improve performance (categories, etc.)
* authenticated_user_id will always stay the same but authenticated_nickname can change.
  Check and update if needed when user logs in
* Reduce character limit for ideas to encourage only one idea per submission
* Do not allow Cascade to be enabled until notes exist
* Consider asking users to suggest categories when ideas created
* Need to better randomize jobs and how presented
* Need to decide how to best calculate voting threshold used in cascade (in steps and when generating categories)
* Enabling and disabling of question should be separate from notes and cascade phases
  Currently disabling and then re-enabling a question looses the current phase and will not allow
  Cascade to be re-enabled w/o deleting any existing data
* Fix "Step x of y" on Cascade UI (problem is y is changing)
* Consider blinking browser header when new step available, or highlighting some way
* Make word clouds clickable (show ideas & categories where word appears)
* Allow question author to set maximum # of ideas allowed
* Remove merge any duplicate ideas before starting cascade
* Make max # uncategorized cascade items allowed a user-configurable parameter; base on percentage of # of items?
* Warn if no categories generated after cascade is complete
* Need to better understand what reasonable defaults should be set in queue.yaml
* Consider whether or not to delete tmp cascade data once categories have been generated (esp. since some tables like cascade_fit_categories_phase1 may get very large)
* Handle active users when question disabled or deleted (logout?)
* Release assignments after some period of inactivity; delete incomplete jobs when user logs out
* Create cronjob to clean up any users who have been logged in for a long time
* Should CASCADE_MAX_UNCATEGORIZED be a fixed number or percentage of ideas?
* Suggest cascade settings based on # of ideas, # of users, etc.

Known Bugs
* Can't submit idea when Chrome "disconnect.me" plugin installed
* When user logs in first time, Google asks for permission and then doesn't always redirect to application as expected
* Nickname authentication NOT working; forget user is logged in when switching between pages sometimes
  
Testing
* Build test harness
  (look at the Firefox extension Selenium: seleniumhq.org)

Design Issues
* General tension between student individual focus and how much they see of collective activity

Google Cloud SQL
* Google Cloud SQL uses MySQL 5.5 (using 5.6 for local testing)
* google_app_engine_sdk_path/google_sql.py
* https://developers.google.com/appengine/training/cloud-sql/deploy_the_app

****** OLD ******

New approaches
* Cluster based on tags
* New clustering approach by asking student to incrementally say which items are most similar
* Final reclustering step based tags
* Have student provide drawings, and do peer clustering
* Provide a picture with a question, and have students point to place on image that provides answer (and aggregate answers)
* Combine with MOOC to give community of participants the ability to participate in real-time with each other
* Regular polls
* "Tag" with a fixed vocabulary - which would turn into a collective grading exercise. If participants could get back
  their originally contributed ideas, then it would turn into a kind of peer grading platform
  
Bugs
* Users occasionally get the same idea assigned to them multiple times - why???
* Need better random assignment algorithm - seems very clumpy
  Made an improvement, need to try it with a class
* Can't submit idea when Chrome "disconnect.me" plugin installed
* Channels raises onError sometimes (even when they are new):
  > Channel ERROR:  utils.js:69
  > Object {description: "", code: 400} utils.js:70

Clustering
