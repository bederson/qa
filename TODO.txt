TODO: update todos!!

*** NEW ***
* need to understand if ok to use MySQL root user when deployed
* need better way to create question id
* create cronjob to clean up any users who have been logged in for a long time
* test on gae-test; remember to import database structure
* when testing, watch that client_ids getting destroyed correctly
* make sure login/logout timestamps being updated at correct times
* record phase step completion times
* authenticated_user_id will always stay the same but authenticated_nickname can change; should it be checked/modified when user logs in
# TODO: create database indexes
# TODO: do ideas, users, etc. need to be created w/in transactions to ensure same id not used when new database item created?
# TODO/FIX: destroy channels after some specified period?
# TODO: could merge users and user_clients if only 1 client allowed per user/question pair
# TODO: person vs. user (variable name)
# TODO: what can be memcached to speed things up?
# TODO: create Google Cloud SQL database user to use instead of root


Bugs
* Users occasionally get the same idea assigned to them multiple times - why???
* Need better random assignment algorithm - seems very clumpy
  Made an improvement, need to try it with a class
* Can't submit idea when Chrome "disconnect.me" plugin installed
* Channels raises onError sometimes (even when they are new):
  > Channel ERROR:  utils.js:69
  > Object {description: "", code: 400} utils.js:70

Features
* Stem tags???
* Allow students to edit their tags
* Auto-complete or show tags that others have already entered for that cluster or idea
  (to make it easier and faster for students to enter tags, and for there to be less diversity
   ... if that's what we want)
* Allow admins to modify questions, in addition to question authors

Testing
* Questions require either user authentication (via google account) or nickname authentication 
  (nickname stored in session). Implemented but needs to be tested (esp. nickname authentication)
  
Misc
* Reduce page reloads to reduce unnecessary server calls and # of channels created
* Need consistent terminology (e.g., submission/note/response/idea for responses to questions)

Engineering
* Better downloading support
* Build test harness
  (look at the Firefox extension Selenium: seleniumhq.org)

New approaches
* Cluster based on tags
* New clustering approach by asking student to incrementally say which items are most similar
* Final reclustering step based tags
* Have student provide drawings, and do peer clustering
* Provide a picture with a question, and have students point to place on image that provides answer (and aggregate answers)
* Combine with MOOC to give community of participants the ability to participate in real-time with each other
* Regular polls
* "Tag" with a fixed vocabulary - which would turn into a collective grading exercise. If participants could get back
  their originally contributed ideas, then it would turn into a kind of peer grading platform

Design issues
* General tension between student individual focus and how much they see of collective activity
* Should complete user name (which is email) be displayed on mouse over in instructor view?

Clustering
* Look at MALLET - http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php
* Read Jordan's paper
