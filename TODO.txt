GAE Deployment
* download and install gsutil to make importing data easier:
  https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/docs/import_export#migrate
* create Google Cloud SQL database user to use instead of root
* GAE taskqueue very slow sometimes; check status at https://code.google.com/status/appengine
  
Suggestions
* Login: make login process easier
* Login: authenticated_user_id will always stay the same but authenticated_nickname can change
         check and update if needed when user logs in

* Notes: consider asking users to suggest categories when ideas created
* Notes: inform users how many ideas have been contributed so far

* Categorize: use stemming when comparing categories for equality
* Categorize: remove/merge any duplicate ideas before starting cascade
* Categorize: need to decide how to best calculate voting threshold used in cascade (in steps and when generating categories)
* Categorize: flag questions whose categories are created before cascade is complete (by instructor)
* Categorize: allow users to cancel all jobs (how to distinguish between cancelled jobs that are re-assigned and skipped jobs that are recorded)
* Categorize: check if job that is holding things up can be assigned to another user (might get more than k/k2 results)
* Categorize: consider unassigning jobs that a user has not finished in some period of time (warn user)
* Categorize: should never wait if only 1 user; if so then user has hit a deadend (e.g., no categories available to fit tasks)
                                      
* Results: add "discuss" button to categories and items and show counts
* Results: allow users to expand/collapse individual categories
* Results: consider showing categories suggested but not used
* Results: display categories like a network where shared notes are the edges
* Results: use Whiz to display results
* Results: When should singletons be removed or included in results
* Results: Create hierarchical categories (look at results of #89507 on qa-umd.appspot.com)
* Results: Make word clouds clickable (show ideas & categories where word appears)

* Admin: Allow question author to release incomplete cascade assignments after some period of inactivity
* Admin: add option to hide names completely for a question
* Admin: Allow admins to logout students
* Admin: Improve how cascade settings and voting thresholds are calculated
* Admin: Need better way to create unique question id

* Misc: Need consistent terminology (e.g., submission/note/response/idea, person/user/author/instructor/admin)
* Misc: Create/check database indexes
* Misc: Destroy channels after some specified period (or does that happen automatically?)
* Misc: Consider what can be stored in datastore and/or memcache to improve performance
* Misc: Need to better understand what reasonable defaults should be set in queue.yaml
* Misc: Reduce usage of Google Cloud Sql where possible to reduce cost
* Misc: Design GUI to work on mobile devices
* Misc: Reduce page reloads to reduce unnecessary server calls and # of channels created
* Misc: Create cronjob to clean up any users who have been logged in for a long time (remember to unassign jobs)
        Consider what needs to be done when channels expire
* Misc: Consider whether or not to delete tmp cascade data once categories have been generated 
        (esp. since some tables like cascade_fit_categories_phase1 may get very large)
* Misc: Code would be cleaner (esp. login/logout) if channel only created once per user
        Currently code is created every time user visits a page and disconnect when they leave it
                
Known Bugs
* Can't submit idea when Chrome "disconnect.me" plugin installed
* When user logs in first time, Google asks for permission and then doesn't always redirect to application as expected
* Observed instance when GUI did not switch from note input to cascade categorization when testing with group
* If many users working concurrently, it may be possible for a job to be assigned to multiple users
  Currently the first job submitted is saved in the database
  Subsequent saved jobs are silently ignored but the count is recorded in the cascade_stats table
  Would need to use transactions and select..for update to fix
  Not sure how frequently this may happen
  Don't think deadlock errors will occur if updates happen at exactly the same time (will wait until lock released)
* If many users working concurrently, it may be possible for multiple users to authenticate with same nickname 
  (but they should still have unique id)
* Sometimes user and channel not deleted from database
  (if user still logged in from before, can they get job assigned if client still exists?)
  
Testing
* Nickname authentication needs to be tested more completely (see known bugs)
* Build test harness
  (look at the Firefox extension Selenium: seleniumhq.org)

Design Issues
* General tension between student individual focus and how much they see of collective activity
* Is it better to make users explicitly select Y or N for category fit tasks or is it ok to default to N to reduce clicks

Google Cloud SQL
* Google Cloud SQL uses MySQL 5.5 (using 5.6 for local testing)
* google_app_engine_sdk_path/google_sql.py
* https://developers.google.com/appengine/training/cloud-sql/deploy_the_app

****** OLD ******

New approaches
* Cluster based on tags
* New clustering approach by asking student to incrementally say which items are most similar
* Final reclustering step based tags
* Have student provide drawings, and do peer clustering
* Provide a picture with a question, and have students point to place on image that provides answer (and aggregate answers)
* Combine with MOOC to give community of participants the ability to participate in real-time with each other
* Regular polls
* "Tag" with a fixed vocabulary - which would turn into a collective grading exercise. If participants could get back
  their originally contributed ideas, then it would turn into a kind of peer grading platform
  
Bugs
* Users occasionally get the same idea assigned to them multiple times - why???
* Need better random assignment algorithm - seems very clumpy
  Made an improvement, need to try it with a class
* Can't submit idea when Chrome "disconnect.me" plugin installed
* Channels raises onError sometimes (even when they are new):
  > Channel ERROR:  utils.js:69
  > Object {description: "", code: 400} utils.js:70

Clustering
