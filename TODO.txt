Bugs
* Can't submit idea when Chrome "disconnect.me" plugin installed

Features
* Edit existing questions
* Allow student pseudonym instead of google account
* Add time stamp to all interactions
* List # ideas/tags given for the current, and # ideas for all questions

New approaches
* New clustering approach based on tagging each item, and then cluster based on tags
  - Need to generalize tagging so that different item types can be tagged
* New clustering approach by asking student to incrementally say which items are most similar
* Final reclustering step based tags
* Have student provide drawings, and do peer clustering
* Provide a picture with a question, and have students point to place on image that provides answer (and aggregate answers)
* Combine with MOOC to give community of participants the ability to participate in real-time with each other
* Regular polls
