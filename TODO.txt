Bugs
* Users occasionally get the same idea assigned to them multiple times - why???
* Need better random assignment algorithm - seems very clumpy
  Made an improvement, need to try it with a class
* Can't submit idea when Chrome "disconnect.me" plugin installed
* Channels raises onError sometimes (even when they are new):
  > Channel ERROR:  utils.js:69
  > Object {description: "", code: 400} utils.js:70

Features
* Stem tags???
* Allow students to edit their tags
* Auto-complete or show tags that others have already entered for that cluster or idea
  (to make it easier and faster for students to enter tags, and for there to be less diversity
   ... if that's what we want)
* Allow admins to modify questions, in addition to question authors

Testing
* Questions require either user authentication (via google account) or nickname authentication 
  (nickname stored in session). Implemented but needs to be tested (esp. nickname authentication)
  
Misc
* Reduce page reloads to reduce unnecessary server calls and # of channels created
* Need to make myself a gae admin so users.is_current_user_admin returns true
* Need consistent terminology (e.g., submission/note/response/idea for responses to questions)
* Datastore ids getting truncated when passed from server via json to client
  Current solution to run dev_server with --auto_id_policy=sequential (since smaller datastore ids used)
  Better solution would be to pass ids as strings instead of numbers
  May not be issue in public server (have not tested)

Engineering
* Better downloading support
* Build test harness
  (look at the Firefox extension Selenium: seleniumhq.org)

New approaches
* Cluster based on tags
* New clustering approach by asking student to incrementally say which items are most similar
* Final reclustering step based tags
* Have student provide drawings, and do peer clustering
* Provide a picture with a question, and have students point to place on image that provides answer (and aggregate answers)
* Combine with MOOC to give community of participants the ability to participate in real-time with each other
* Regular polls
* "Tag" with a fixed vocabulary - which would turn into a collective grading exercise. If participants could get back
  their originally contributed ideas, then it would turn into a kind of peer grading platform

Design issues
* General tension between student individual focus and how much they see of collective activity
* Should complete user name (which is email) be displayed on mouse over in instructor view?

Clustering
* Look at MALLET - http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php
* Read Jordan's paper
