# tasks have a maximum of 10 minutes to execute

# Set the total storage limit for all queues to 500MB (default limit for free apps)
total_storage_limit: 500M

# bucket_size: limits the burstiness of the queue's processing, i.e. a higher bucket 
# size allows bigger spikes in the queue's execution rate. For example, consider a queue 
# with a rate of 5/s and a bucket size of 10. If that queue has been inactive for some time 
# (allowing its "token bucket" to fill up), and 20 tasks are suddenly enqueued, it will be 
# allowed to execute 10 tasks immediately. But in the following second, only 5 more tasks 
# will be able to be executed because the token bucket has been depleted and is refilling at 
# the specified rate of 5/s.
# If no bucket_size is specified for a queue, the default value is 5.

# rate: how often tasks are processed on this queue. The value is a number followed by a 
# slash and a unit of time, where the unit is s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, or 
# d for days. For example, the value 5/m says tasks will be processed at a rate of 5 times 
# per minute. If the number is 0 (such as 0/s), the queue is considered "paused," and no tasks 
# are processed.

# max_concurrent_requests: sets the maximum number of tasks that can be executed at any given 
# time in the specified queue. The value is an integer. By default, this directive is unset 
# and there is no limit on the maximum number of concurrent tasks. One use of this directive 
# is to prevent too many tasks from running at once or to prevent datastore contention.
# Restricting the maximum number of concurrent tasks gives you more control over your queue's 
# rate of execution. For example, you can constrain the number of instances that are running the 
# queue's tasks. Limiting the number of concurrent requests in a given queue allows you to make 
# resources available for other queues or online processing.
